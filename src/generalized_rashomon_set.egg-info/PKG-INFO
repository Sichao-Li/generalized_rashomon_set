# Exploring the Cloud of Feature Interaction Scores in a Rashomon Set


This repository includes the implementation of the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10181). The paper emphasizes the importance of investigating feature interactions not just in a single predictive model, but across a range of well-performing models, illustrated below.

## Summary

The paper introduces a novel approach to understanding feature interactions in machine learning models. The authors argue that the study of feature interactions in a single model can miss complex relationships between features. Thus, they recommend exploring these interactions across a set of similarly accurate models, known as a Rashomon set.

The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduction of the Feature Interaction Score (FIS) as a means to quantify the strength of feature interactions within a predictive model.
2. Proposal of the FIS Cloud (FISC), a collection of FISs across a Rashomon set, to explore how feature interactions contribute to predictions and how these interactions can vary across models.
3. Presentation of a non-linear example in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to characterize the Rashomon set and FISC. This includes a search algorithm to explore FIS and to characterize FISC in a Rashomon set along with two novel visualization tools, namely Halo and Swarm plots.

## Requirements
FISC is a designed based on Python language and specific libraries. Four most commonly-used are listed as follows:

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

FISC is a model-agnostic framework and experiments might have different requirements, depending on the data and model
types. To implement the experiments in the paper, dependencies in [requirements.txt](.\requirements.txt) are required.

```python
python -r .\requirements
```

## Installment

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ generalized-rashomon-set
```
### Usage
```
import grs

# train a MLP model
model =  MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes, max_iter=200).fit(X, y)

# explain the model by exploring the Rashomon set
explainer = grs.explainers.fis_explainer()

# visualize the predictions
grs.plots.swarm_plot()
grs.plots.halo_plot()
```

## Demo

A toy example shows how halo plot illustrates the effect of feature interaction 
in [toy-example.ipynb](.\demo\toy_example.ipynb), results are shown below.
